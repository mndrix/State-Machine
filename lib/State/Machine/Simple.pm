=head1 DESCRIPTION

State::Machine::Simple is a micro-framework for defining simple state machines
using L<State::Machine>. L<State::Machine> allows you to define a process, model
interactions, and enforce the integrity of those interactions. State machines
can also be used as a system for processing and reasoning about long-running
asynchronous transactions. As an example of the functionality provided by this
DSL, the follow is a demonstration of modeling a fictitious call-center process
modeled using State::Machine::Simple. This library is a Moose-based
implementation of the L<State::Machine> library.

    package CallCenter::Workflow::TelephoneCall;

    use State::Machine::Simple -dsl;

    topic 'support telephone call';

    # initial state
    at_state ringing => (
        # next transition
        next => 'connect',

        # applicable transitions
        when => {
            hangup  => 'disconnected', # transition -> resulting state
            connect => 'connected',    # transition -> resulting state
        }
    );

    in_state connected => (
        next => 'request_dept',
        when => {
            hangup       => 'disconnected',
            request_dept => 'transferred',
        }
    );

    in_state transferred => (
        next => 'answer',
        when => {
            hangup    => 'disconnected',
            voicemail => 'disconnected',
            answer    => 'answered',
        }
    );

    in_state answered => (
        next => 'hangup',
        when => {
            hangup => 'disconnected'
        }
    );

    in_state 'disconnected'; # end-state (cannot transition from)

=export -dsl

The dsl export group exports all functions instrumental in modeling a simple
state machine. The following is a list of functions exported by this group:

=over 4

=item *

at_state

=item *

in_state

=item *

topic

=back

=function at_state

    at_state name => (%attributes);

    at_state answered => (when => { hangup => 'disconnected' });
    # using the telephone example provided in the description, this state
    # definition can be read as ... a $state (answered) $topic (support
    # telephone call) $transition (hangup) and is now $state (disconnected)

The at_state function is analogous to the in_state function and additionally
denotes that it's state definition is the root state (starting point).

=function in_state

    in_state name => (%attributes);

    in_state connected => (when => { request_dept => 'transferred' });
    # using the telephone example provided in the description, this state
    # definition can be read as ... a $state (connected) $topic (support
    # telephone call) $transition (request_dept) and is now $state (transferred)

The in_state function defines a state and optionally it's transitions. The
in_state function requires a state name as it's first argument, and optionally
a list of attributes that will be used to configure other state behavior. The
value of the C<when> attribute should be a hashref whose keys are names of
transitions, and whose values are names of states.

=function topic

    topic 'process credit card';

The topic function takes an arbitrary string which describes the purpose or
intent of the state machine.
