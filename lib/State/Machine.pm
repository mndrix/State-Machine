        name   => 'turn_off',
        result => $is_off
    );

    $is_on->add_transition($turn_off); # on -> turn off
    $is_off->add_transition($turn_on); # off -> turn on

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (plural: automata), or
simply a state machine, is an abstract machine that can be in one of a finite
number of states. The machine is in only one state at a time. It can change from
one state to another when initiated by a triggering event or condition; this is
called a transition. State::Machine is a system for creating state machines and
managing their transitions; It is also a great mechanism for enforcing and
tracking workflow, especially in distributed computing. This library is a
Moose-based implementation of the L<State::Machine> library.

State machines are useful for modeling systems with perform a predetermined
sequence of event and result in deterministic state. State::Machine, as you
might expect, allows for the definition of events, states, state transitions
and user defined actions that can be executed before or after transitions. All
features of the state machine itself can be configured via a DSL,
L<State::Machine::Simple>. B<Note: This is an early release available for
testing and feedback and as such is subject to change.>

=has state

    my $state = $machine->state;
    $state = $machine->state(State::Machine::State->new(...));

The current state of the state machine. The value should be a
L<State::Machine::State> object.

=has topic

    my $topic = $machine->topic;
    $topic = $machine->topic('Take over the world');

The topic or purpose of the state machine. The value can be any arbitrary
string describing intent.

=method apply

    my $state = $machine->apply('transition_name');
    $state = $machine->apply; # apply known next transition

The apply method transitions the state machine from the current state into the
resulting state. If the apply method is called without a transition name, the
machine will transition into the next known state of the current state.

=method next

    my $transition_name = $machine->next;

The next method returns the name of the next known transition of the current
state if exists, otherwise it will return undefined.

=method status

    my $state_name = $machine->status;

The status method returns the name of the current state.
